# AthenaVI Dashboard - Presentation Script

## Opening (30 seconds)

**Script:**
"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Today I'm excited to present the AthenaVI dashboard—a video creation and management platform I've designed. This is a modern, intuitive interface that helps users manage videos, avatars, voices, and other assets in one place. Let me walk you through the key features and design decisions."

## 1. Dashboard Overview & Navigation (1-2 minutes)

**Script:**
"Let's start with the overall structure. The dashboard uses a clean, two-column layout with a persistent sidebar navigation on the left and a main content area. This ensures users can quickly access any section without losing context.

The sidebar is organized into two main categories:
- **NAVIGATION**: Home, Videos, Workspace, Shared with Me, and Trash
- **ASSETS**: Library, Brand Kits, Avatars, and Voices

At the top, we have a header bar with a search function, a prominent 'Create' button for quick access to video creation, and a profile menu. The design uses a professional color palette with blue accents for interactive elements, maintaining a corporate aesthetic."

**Demo Actions:**
- Show sidebar navigation
- Hover over menu items
- Point out the "Create" button
- Show profile menu

## 2. Home Page - "My Recents" (1 minute)

**Script:**
"The Home page serves as a dashboard overview. I've kept it focused and clean, removing clutter like statistics and templates. Instead, it features 'My Recents'—showing recently accessed videos in both grid and list views.

Users can quickly see their latest work, with each video card displaying:
- A thumbnail preview with avatar images
- Status badges (Draft or Published)
- Video duration
- Last updated timestamp
- Quick action menu

The view toggle lets users switch between grid and list layouts based on their preference."

- **View Modes**: Toggle between grid and list views for both folders and videos
- **Quick Actions**: Each video and folder has a context menu with rename and delete options
